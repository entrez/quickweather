A very-concise summary of current weather conditions without manually
entering zip code or lat/long whenever you move around.

quickweather uses the openweathermap api <https://openweathermap.org/>;
you can register for an account, and a corresponding api key, for free:

        <https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up>

Once you have an api key, store it in the variable `$OPENWEATHERKEY`.

The weather icons used are compatible with the terminal font
`scientifica' <https://github.com/NerdyPepper/scientifica>, and I guess
probably also with `creep' <https://github.com/romeovs/creep>. I think
the codepoints used are non-standard so I doubt it will be compatible
with most fonts.
