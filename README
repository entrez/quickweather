# quickweather

this is a small script designed to do one thing quickly: display a concise
summary of the current weather conditions without requiring the user to
manually input a zip code or lat/long whenever they change locations.

in order to do this, it uses the [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/)
api, and use requires an api key (which should be stored in the variable
`$OPENWEATHERKEY`). you can register for an account, and a corresponding
api key, for free [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).

the weather icons used are compatible with [scientifica](https://github.com/NerdyPepper/scientifica),
but I don't know whether they will work with any other fonts or not.
